Once upon a time, in a forest there lives a monkey who resided on a berry tree, which was on the
bank of river. In a same forest, there lives a crocodile and his wife... One day the crocodile came
to the bank of the river and rested under the tree. The kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits.
The crocodile came back the next day for more fruits, and he loved them. As days past by, the crocodile and the monkey became good friends.
