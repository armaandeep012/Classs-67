Once upon a time, in a forest there lives a monkey who resided on a berry tree, which was on the
bank of river. In a same forest, there lives a crocodile and his wife... One day the crocodile came
to the bank of the river and rested under the tree. The kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits.
The crocodile came back the next day for more fruits, and he loved them. As days past by, the crocodile and the monkey became good friends.

One day, monkey sent some fruits for the wife. She ate the fuits and liked them, but was jealous, as she did not like her husband spending time with the monkey. She toled her husband, "if the fruits are so juicy, I wonder how sweet the monkey's heart would be". Get me the heart of the monkey. The corocodile was not willing to kill his friend, but had no choice.
